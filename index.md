## About me
I am a researcher in experimental condensed matter physics with expertise in **crystal growth**, **X-ray diffraction**, and the study of **magnetism in quantum materials**. My work focuses on **frustrated magnetism**, **low-dimensional spin systems**, and **hexagonal perovskite compounds** containing face-sharing transition-metal octahedra.

I combine techniques such as **magnetization**, **heat capacity**, and **transport measurements** with collaborations involving advanced probes like **neutron scattering** and **muon spin rotation (µSR)**. Broadly, I aim to understand how structural motifs and electronic correlations yield emergent ground states such as **quantum spin liquids** and **spin-glass behavior**.
