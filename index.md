## About Me

I am a researcher in **experimental condensed matter physics** with a strong focus on the growth and study of **quantum magnetic materials**. My expertise lies in **single-crystal growth**, **X-ray diffraction**, and a variety of **low-temperature measurements** (magnetization, heat capacity, and transport).  

My research is centered on understanding novel magnetic ground states in **frustrated magnets** and **correlated electron systems**, particularly in compounds where the crystal structure itself drives unconventional physics. A major part of my work focuses on:

- **One-dimensional zigzag spin-1/2 chains**, where reduced dimensionality and frustration can stabilize exotic ground states.  
- **Hexagonal perovskites containing face-sharing CoO₆, RhO₆, and IrO₆ octahedra**, forming **dimers and trimers** that host unusual quantum magnetic phenomena.  
- Exploration of **localized versus itinerant electronic behavior** and the role of **molecular orbital formation** or **orbital-selective Mott states** in shaping the low-energy physics.  

Through this lens, I investigate how **geometric frustration**, **orbital degrees of freedom**, and **disorder/defects** (such as cation mixing or oxygen vacancies) interplay to produce emergent phases such as **quantum spin liquids**, **spin-glass states**, and **orbital-selective correlated phases**.  

I actively collaborate with groups using advanced probes such as **neutron scattering** and **muon spin rotation (µSR)** to complement bulk measurements, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of spin correlations and low-energy excitations.

## Research Vision
My broader goal is to **unravel the interplay between structure, orbital physics, and magnetism** in low-dimensional and frustrated systems. By connecting **crystal chemistry, local electronic structure, and many-body physics**, I aim to discover and understand novel correlated phases that could form the basis for **new paradigms in quantum magnetism**.
