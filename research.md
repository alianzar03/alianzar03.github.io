# Research

My research focuses on **magnetism in quantum materials**, with a particular emphasis on how crystal structure, electronic correlations, and orbital degrees of freedom conspire to produce unconventional ground states. I combine **crystal growth**, **X-ray diffraction**, and **thermodynamic/transport measurements** with collaborative studies using advanced probes (neutron scattering, µSR, synchrotron techniques).

## 1. Low-Dimensional and Frustrated Magnetism
Reduced dimensionality and frustration often stabilize exotic spin states not found in conventional magnets. I study:

- **Zigzag spin-1/2 chains** in compounds such as *ACoV₂O₇ (A = Ca, Sr, Zn)*, where competing exchange interactions lead to frustration and unconventional ground states.  
- Emergence of **long-range antiferromagnetism**, **quantum critical behavior**, or **spin-glass freezing** depending on dimensionality, anisotropy, and disorder.  
- The broader role of **low connectivity lattices** in enabling spin-liquid-like fluctuations.

## 2. Face-Sharing Octahedra: Dimers and Trimers
Hexagonal perovskites with face-sharing transition-metal octahedra provide a unique setting where short metal–metal distances drive strong orbital overlap:

- **CoO₆ dimers and Rh/Ir-based trimers** act as molecular-like units, leading to **bond-centered magnetism** and **orbital-selective physics**.  
- Competition between **localized moments** and **molecular orbital formation** can give rise to **orbital-selective Mott states**.  
- Investigations of compounds such as *Ba₃SbCo₂O₉*, *Ba₄SbRh₃O₁₂*, and *Ba₄NbIr₃O₁₂* reveal diverse electronic and magnetic ground states.

## 3. Correlated Electron Phenomena
The coexistence of strong Coulomb interactions and structural motifs produces complex correlated states:

- **Localized versus itinerant behavior** tuned by orbital hybridization.  
- **Orbital-selective Mott transitions**, where some orbitals remain localized while others delocalize.  
- Role of **oxygen vacancies** and **cation disorder** in modifying exchange pathways, leading to **cluster spin-glass states**.

## 4. Experimental Toolkit
- **Crystal growth:** optical floating-zone, flux, and solid-state synthesis.  
- **Structural studies:** powder and single-crystal XRD, Laue diffraction.  
- **Physical property measurements:** magnetization (MPMS), heat capacity and transport (PPMS).  
- **Collaborations:** neutron scattering, muon spin rotation (µSR), synchrotron X-ray techniques.

## Research Vision
Through these studies, I aim to uncover guiding principles that connect **crystal chemistry, orbital physics, and magnetism**. The ultimate goal is to identify and understand **new emergent states of matter**—from quantum spin liquids and orbital-selective Mott states to unconventional spin-glass phases—arising from the delicate balance of **structure, correlation, and dimensionality**.
