# Research

My group/our work focuses on the interplay between **structure and magnetism** in transition‑metal oxides and related quantum materials.

## Current themes
- **Face‑sharing octahedra dimers/trimers** in hexagonal perovskites (e.g., Ba₃SbCo₂O₉, Ba₄SbRh₃O₁₂).  
- **Low‑dimensional magnetism**: zigzag chains and layered lattices.  
- **Frustration & disorder**: cluster spin‑glass behavior, Co/Sb intersite mixing, oxygen vacancies.

## Experimental toolkit
- Crystal growth (floating‑zone, flux).
- X‑ray diffraction (powder, single‑crystal, Laue).  
- Physical properties: **magnetization (MPMS)**, **heat capacity (PPMS)**, transport.  
- Collaborations: neutron scattering, µSR.

## Open questions
- How do face‑sharing motifs tune exchange pathways and anisotropy?  
- Can disorder/defects be engineered to stabilize new magnetic states?  
- What minimal models capture the observed low‑T thermodynamics and spin dynamics?
